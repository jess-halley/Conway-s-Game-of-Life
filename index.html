    <p>Science is my big passion,
      so for my creative JavaScript challenge, I wanted to recreate the conditions for cellular simulation originally established by mathematician John Horton Conway.
      This model is commonly known as Conway's Game of Life. The conditions are surprisingly simple.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p1> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies as if caused by underpopulation. </p1>
    <p1> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. </p1>
    <p1> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. </p1>
    <p1> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</p1>
  </div>

    <div>
      <p> Using JavaScript you can write a program that responds to these rules. The end result is the beautiful cellular automaton you'll see when you click the start button below.
        This is a digital representation of what cells do under the microscope.
        It is possible to create a more interactive game out of these conditions whereby the user must work out the best route to creating life,
        but unfortunately, I'm not clever enough for that yet.
